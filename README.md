# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End


## Your Task

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

You’ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

### Fill Out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations

Fill out the unfinished routes in `product-routes.js`, `tag-routes.js`, and `category-routes.js` to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.

> **Hint**: Be sure to look at the mini-project code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what `req.body` will be for POST and PUT routes!

### Seed the Database

After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the e-commerce back end must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your readme file.

* The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to create the schema from the MySQL shell.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to seed the database from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to start the application’s server.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags being tested in Insomnia.
